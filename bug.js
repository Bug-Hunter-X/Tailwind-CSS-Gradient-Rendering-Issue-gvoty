```javascript
// ... your Tailwind CSS code ...

<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4">
  <p>Some text here</p>
</div>
```
This code uses the `bg-gradient-to-r` utility class, but the gradient isn't showing up correctly.  The colors seem to be wrong or the gradient is not applied as expected.
