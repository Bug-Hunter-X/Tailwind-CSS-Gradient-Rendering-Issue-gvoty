# Tailwind CSS Gradient Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS gradients are not rendering correctly. The gradient colors are unexpected, or the gradient effect itself is missing.  This issue might arise from conflicts with other CSS or an incorrect Tailwind setup.

## Bug Description

The `bg-gradient-to-r` class, along with other gradient classes, is not producing the expected visual output. This results in either incorrect color display within the gradient or a complete lack of the gradient effect.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies (if any).
3. Run the application (instructions might vary).
4. Observe the unexpected gradient rendering in the designated area of the UI.

## Solution

The solution involves a specific adjustment to address the conflict or misconfiguration.  See `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code.
